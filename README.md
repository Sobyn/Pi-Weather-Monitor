# Pi-Weather-Monitor
Welcome to my first public Github repository: A weather monitor using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and a Sense HAT.
The weather data is stored in an SQL database, and displayed on a Flask-based website, featuring plots made with matplotlib.

Clone the repository, create your own SQL database, import the weather_db.sql database, and install the packages listed in requirements.txt!

All required packages can be installed at once by executing the following command in a terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Remember to enter the appropriate database details in both temp.py and weatherpage.py!
